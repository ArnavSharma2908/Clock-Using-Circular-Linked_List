# Clock-Using-Circular-Linked_List
### This project showcases a clock and time ticking by leveraging the concept of a linked list in the form of circles, commonly known as a circular linked list. This project uses the Turtle library to display the clock and seamlessly applies object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create both nodes for the circular linked list and the clock itself.

##### Tech Stack: `Main.py` runs the main function of `Clock_Drawing_by_Turtle.py`, which is responsible for displaying the clock based on parameters received. Parameters of time are received from `Linked_Lists_Time_Generator.py`, in which the `create_CLL()` function creates a time object (circular linked lists) with a customized start as per the parameter, and the `tick()` function ticks the clock.
