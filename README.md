# Clock-Using-Circular-Linked_List

This project demonstrates a clock that ticks by leveraging the concept of a circular linked list. It uses Python's Turtle library to display the clock visually and incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create both nodes for the circular linked list and the clock itself. Additionally, the Cohere API is utilized to enhance chatbot functionality and assist the users with their queries and troublshooted experience.

## About the Project

This project showcases the integration of data structures and graphical interfaces through the following features:

- A clock interface that updates in real-time using a circular linked list to manage time.
- The Turtle library for rendering the clock face and hands.
- Object-oriented principles to encapsulate clock components and behavior.
- Chatbot functionality powered by the Cohere API for interactive guidance.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Turtle Library**: For graphical clock rendering.
- **Cohere API**: Enables chatbot integration for developer assistance.

## Installation

To install and run the Clock-Using-Circular-Linked_List project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArnavSharma2908/Clock-Using-Circular-Linked_List
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd Clock-Using-Circular-Linked_List
   ```

3. Ensure Python 3 is installed. No external modules are required.

---

## Usage

1. Run the main file to start the clock:
   
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

2. The clock will render an analog display with ticking functionality, and the chatbot will provide assistance or additional information as required.

## Features

- **Circular Linked List**: Implements timekeeping logic using nodes to represent hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Graphical Display**: Renders a dynamic clock using the Turtle library.
- **OOP Design**: Encapsulation of clock logic in modular components.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Assists with project details and troubleshooting via the Cohere API.
