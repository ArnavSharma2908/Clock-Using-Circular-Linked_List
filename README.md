# Clock-Using-Circular-Linked_List
### This Project is showcasing CLock and Time Ticking by leveraging the concept of Linked List in the form of Circles commonly known as Circular Linked List. This Project is using turtle library to display clock and using Concepts of Object Oriented Programming Skills (OOPS) seamlessly to create both Nodes for Circular LinkedList and Clock Itself.

##### TechStack: Main.py runs the main function of 'Clock_Drawing_by_Turtle.py' whose function is to Display clock based on parameters recieved. Paramters of time are being recived from Linked_Lists_Time_Generator.py in which create_CLL() function creates a time object (Circular Linked Lists) with customized start as per parameter and tick() function ticks the clock.
